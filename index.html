    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            
            Over the last few days, I and a team of KONAM FOUNDATION employees conducted a survey on cotton farming. This survey was undertaken  for  the  aim of gaining valuable insights into the cotton farming practices adopted by local farmers in the village of Kattangur , Nalgonda district.<p>
            
            </p>
            
            Eight dedicated cotton farmers graciously shared their experiences, techniques, and challenges faced in the cultivating of this crop. This survey focused on aspects ranging from land management, soil health, and crop varieties to irrigation methods, pest control, and yield optimization.<p>

            </p>
            
            By delving into the specifics of each farmer's approach, we aim to identify best practices and potential areas for improvement. The gathered data will not only enrich our understanding of cotton farming but also contribute to the collective knowledge  for agricultural development in the region.<p>

            </p>
            
            We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the participating farmers for their valuable contributions. Their insights are invaluable in shaping a sustainable future for cotton farming in Nalgonda.

    <h2>Demographics and Land Management</h2>
   
    <p>
    
        The survey was conducted with a diverse group of cotton farmers, comprising individuals of varying age ,groups and genders. The participants, all of them are having passion for agriculture, shared invaluable insights into their land management practices.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of land management, the surveyed farmers could be classified based on their ownership or leasing arrangements.The categories included are:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Small Landholders (Below 1.00 hectare)</li>
        <li>Marginal Landholders (1.00-2.00 hectares)</li>
        <li>Semi-Medium Landholders (2.00-4.00 hectares)</li>
        <li>Medium Landholders (4.00-10.00 hectares)</li>
        <li>Large Landholders (above 10.00 hectares)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This diverse range of land sizes plays a vital role in influencing farming practices and strategies, showcasing the adaptability and resilience of the farming community in Nalgonda.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's noteworthy that a portion of the farmers operate under leasing agreements, which involve paying lease charges for the land they cultivate. These lease charges can vary based on factors such as land size, location, and soil fertility.Lease charges may vary from 6000 Rupees to 12000 Rupees depends on facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, some farmers have adopted sustainable land management practices including crop rotation, to optimize soil health and long-term productivity. This forward-thinking approach exemplifies their commitment to responsible and environmentally-conscious farming techniques.
    </p>

    <h2>Soil Type and Soil Test</h2>
    <p>
        Kattangur village exhibits a diverse range of soil types, with Red Soil, Black Soil, and Sandy loam Soil . Red Soil, characterized by its rich iron content, is widely utilized by the majority of farmers surveyed. This soil type offers favorable conditions for various crops and has become a staple choice for cultivation in the region.
    </p>
    <p>
        The commitment of few farmers to soil health is evident through their active engagement in regular soil testing. By conducting these tests, farmers gain valuable insights into nutrient levels and pH balances, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding fertilizer application. But, majority of the farmers are not having idea of how to do soil test and don't know the importance of soil test.

    <h2>Cotton Cultivation Process</h2>
    
    <p>
        Cotton cultivation involves a series of well-defined steps to ensure a successful yield. Here's a comprehensive overview of the cultivation process:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Land Preparation and Plowing</h3>
    <p>
        Before sowing cotton seeds, farmers meticulously prepare the land. This includes plowing the fields to create a suitable seedbed. The plowing process helps in breaking up the soil, improving aeration, and facilitating water penetration.On an average it will takes 4 hours of plowing per acre.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Seed Sowing and Germination</h3>
    <p>
        Cotton seeds are sown in rows at optimal spacing. Adequate spacing is crucial for proper plant development and to prevent competition for nutrients. After sowing, the seeds germinate, and young cotton plants emerge from the soil.On an average it will takes 3 and half packets per acre.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Fertilization</h3>
    <p>
        Fertilizers play a vital role in the growth of cotton plants. Farmers apply a balanced mix of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to meet the nutritional needs of the crop. Proper fertilization enhances plant vigor and contributes to higher yields.By combining three different nutrients they will use 200kgs per acre.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Pest Control and Disease Management</h3>
    <p>
        Protecting cotton crops from pests and diseases is essential.  techniques like spraying fertizers are implemented to control pests, and fungicides are used to manage diseases effectively.Many of the farmers dont know which type of pests to use they will use  whatever given by the fertilizer shops
    </p>

    <h3>5. Flowering and Boll Formation</h3>
    <p>
        Cotton plants go through the flowering stage, during which pollination occurs. After successful pollination, bolls begin to form. Bolls are protective capsules that house the cotton fibers.
    </p>
    <img src="C:\Users\udayk\Downloads\Screenshot 2023-11-10 122415.jpg" alt="Flowering and Boll Formation"width="300" height="200" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

    <h3>6. Harvesting</h3>
    <p>
        Harvesting is a crucial phase in cotton cultivation. Farmers harvest the mature bolls when they have reached the desired level of maturity. manual labor is employed for harvesting, depending on the scale of cultivation.There is huge problem for labour availability. Because , mostly all farmers will get crop at same time and shortage of labour is main problem for Farmers.

<section>
    <h2>Water Source and Irrigation Practices for Cotton</h2>
    
    <h3>Water Sources</h3>
    <p>
        Cotton cultivation in Kattangur village relies on various water sources to meet irrigation needs. Farmers utilize different water supply methods, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        
        <li>Groundwater: Extracting water from wells or borewells .</li>
        <li>Rainwater : utilizing rainwater for irrigation.</li>
        <P> 
         Majority of the farmers are directly depends on rainwater and in our survey only 2 farmers utilized borewell water source.   
        </P>
        
    <p>
        The choice of water source and irrigation method depends on factors like water availability, soil type, and the specific needs of cotton plants.

    <h2>Crop Yield and Financial Aspects</h2>

    <p>
        Cotton cultivation involves a careful consideration of various factors influencing both the yield of the crop and the financial aspects associated with its cultivation. Here's a theoretical perspective on these key components:
    </p>

    <h3>Crop Yield per Acre</h3>
    <p>
        Crop yield is a fundamental metric in cotton cultivation, representing the amount of cotton produced per unit of land, typically measured in acres. Several factors influence crop yield, including soil quality, water availability, climate conditions, and effective pest control measures. Farmers aim to optimize these factors to achieve a high and sustainable crop yield. Successful cotton cultivation involves careful management of these variables to ensure a productive harvest.Majority of the farmers in our survey told that last year They got only 5,6 quintals per acre. Last year they are affected with heavy rains and crop was damaged.This year they are expecting very less yield compare to last year.Reason for this is less rain for this year.In our survey they told If they get above 8 quintals per acre then they will be profitable 
    </p>

    <h3>Financial Overview</h3>
    <p>
        The financial aspects of cotton cultivation encompass the entire economic cycle from the initial investment to the final returns. This includes the total cost incurred in the cultivation process for machinery which takes aroung 4 hours of tractor usage per acre and average cost per one hour is 1000 Rupees, such as expenses on seeds it takes 3 packets per acre and average cost is 800 rupees per packet, fertilizers cost around 4000 Rupees per acre, pesticides cost around 8000 Rupees per acre,  labor charges 350 rupees per one, and other inputs. Farmers carefully assess these costs to determine the overall financial investment in their cotton farms. Subsequently, the profit or loss incurred is a critical metric that directly depends on the crop yield.On an average it takes around 30 - 35 thousand Rupees per one acre.Last year many farmers got loss due heavy rains and less crop yield.This year farmers are expecting more loss compared to last year because of low Rainfall.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the yearr 2022 average price per quintal is 6500 rupees and this year at present rate is 6900 rupees .Farmers are expecting Minimum Support Price(MSP) of 8000 Rupees above
    </p>
    <p>
        In summary, achieving a balance between optimizing crop yield and managing the associated financial aspects is essential for the success and sustainability of cotton cultivation.

        <h2>Government Schemes in Agriculture</h2>
        <img src= "C:\Users\udayk\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2023-10-08 144525.png"alt="Rythu Bandhu" width="300" height="200" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
        <p>The government has implemented various schemes to support farmers and promote sustainable agriculture. Here are some key initiatives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rythu Bandhu Scheme</li>
            
        </ul>
        <p>
            <h3> Positive Aspects</h3>
        </p>
        <P>
            <h4> Direct Financial Support:</h4> Rythu Bandhu provides direct financial support to farmers by offering a fixed amount 10000 Rupees per acre of land owned by the farmer. This support is not linked to the type of crop grown, providing flexibility to farmers.

        <P> 

    </P><h4>Income Stabilization:</h4> The scheme aims to stabilize the income of farmers by providing financial assistance at the beginning of the cropping season. This helps farmers meet their initial investment requirements, including the purchase of seeds, fertilizers, and other inputs.
        </P>
        <h3>Negative Aspects</h3>
        <P>
            <h3>Exclusion of Tenant Farmers:</h3> The scheme primarily benefits land-owning farmers, potentially leaving out tenant farmers who cultivate land but do not own it. This exclusion could perpetuate the challenges faced by tenant farmers in accessing financial support.
        </P>
        <h2>Requesting More Schemes</h2>
        <P>
            <h3>1. Subsidies on Seeds and Fertilizers:</h3>

            Farmers are requesting additional support in the form of increased subsidies on seeds and fertilizers. Access to high-quality seeds and fertilizers is essential for optimizing crop yields. Enhanced subsidies can alleviate the financial burden on farmers and empower them to invest in improved agricultural inputs
        </P>
        <P>
            <h3>2. Reduced Diesel Prices:</h3>

The farming community is urging for a reduction in diesel prices, which directly impact the operational costs associated with agricultural machinery and transportation. Lowering diesel prices can contribute to cost-effectiveness in farm operations, making farming more economically viable for the farmers.
        </P>
        <p>
            <h3>3. Financial Support for Tenant Farmers:</h3>

There is a collective call for extending financial support to tenant farmers who, despite their significant contribution to agricultural activities, may not directly benefit from certain schemes. Inclusivity in financial assistance ensures that all stakeholders in the agricultural ecosystem receive the necessary support for sustainable farming practices
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>4. Minimum Support Price (MSP) Assurance:</h3>

Farmers are Requesting for a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their produce. A guaranteed MSP provides farmers with a safety net, assuring them of a reasonable income for their crops. This measure encourages agricultural sustainability from farmers against market fluctuations.

<p>In conclusion, these requests reflect the genuine concerns and needs of the farming community. Addressing these key areas, including subsidies, diesel prices, support for tenant farmers, and MSP assurance, can contribute to the overall well-being of farmers and foster a resilient agricultural sector. It is essential for policymakers to consider these requests in shaping comprehensive and farmer-centric agricultural policies</p>
